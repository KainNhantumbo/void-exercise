Hi,

This is the repository for the VOID Mozambique test.\
Please follow the instructions below for the local setup and build.

## 🐾 Project Stack (and main packages)

- **React.JS** - library used to build big, fast Web apps with JavaScript.
- **Typescript** - a superset language of Javascript that provides typechecking.
- **Tailwind CSS** - for component styling.
- **Vite** - a next generation frontend tooling.

## 🏗️ Local Setup

Make sure you have installed **Node.js (v20.11.0 or later recommended) which also comes with npm v10.2.4**.\
In the project directory, you can run in terminal:

- Runs the app in the development mode and the server will reload when you make changes to the source code for the render and electron scripts:

```bash
npm ci && npm run dev
```

- Builds the web version of the app for production to the **dist folder**:

```bash
npm run build
```
